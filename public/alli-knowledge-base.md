# Alli - AI Lead Detection Platform

## What is Alli?

Alli is an AI-powered lead detection platform that identifies anonymous website visitors and provides their verified contact information. It helps businesses turn their existing website traffic into actionable sales leads without additional ad spend.

## Core Value Proposition

**"See who visited. Get their contact info. Close more deals."**

- Identifies up to 30% of anonymous website visitors
- Delivers verified personal email addresses
- Enables immediate follow-up by sales teams
- Zero extra headcount required
- No additional ad spend needed

## The Problem Alli Solves

### The Visibility Gap
- **97% of website visitors leave without filling out a form**
- Analytics show anonymous numbers but not identities
- CRM shows closed deals but misses the pipeline in between
- By the time leads fill out forms, they've already visited 3+ competitors

### Hidden Revenue Drains
1. **Ad Spend Without Follow-Up**: Businesses pay for SEO, paid ads, and social clicks but can't convert anonymous traffic into pipeline
2. **Anonymous Traffic = Lost Pipeline**: Without visitor identities, marketing spend never becomes revenue
3. **Late Follow-Up**: Sales teams reach out too late - after prospects have already shopped competitors
