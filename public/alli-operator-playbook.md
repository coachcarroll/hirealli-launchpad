# Alli Operator Code of Conduct & Playbook

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** Carroll Media / Alli Platform
**Applies To:** All Alli Operators & Customer Success Associates
**Working Hours:** Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM–4:00 PM EST
**Communication Channel:** Async only (in‑app messaging)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Playbook

This document defines **how Alli shows up in the world** through the people operating her.

Alli is not a chatbot. She is a **first AI team member** — and every interaction must feel:

* Human
* Consistent
* Reliable
* Intelligent
* Calm under pressure

Your role is to **protect the illusion of presence without deception** and to ensure customers feel supported, guided, and confident at every touchpoint.

This playbook exists to:

* Create consistency across all operators
* Protect customer trust
* Scale support without sacrificing authenticity
* Eliminate guesswork and improvisation

---

## 2. The Alli Operator Role (Plain English)

You are not "customer service."

You are an **Alli Operator** — the human layer behind Alli's presence.

### Your core mission

Make every customer feel like:

> "Someone smart, calm, and capable is paying attention to my business."

### What you do daily

* Respond to inbound messages inside the Alli platform
* Guide customers through setup, usage, and troubleshooting
* Proactively check in on customers
* Follow up on failed billing or paused campaigns
* Re‑engage demo and trial users
* Document outcomes clearly so nothing slips

### What you do NOT do

* Cold call
* Pressure sell
* Guess answers
* Over‑explain
* Argue with customers

---

## 3. Non‑Negotiable Standards (Read Carefully)

These are not suggestions.

1. **Reliability beats talent** – show up, every shift
2. **Accuracy over speed** – fast is good, wrong is unacceptable
3. **Warmth without fluff** – friendly, not casual
4. **Ownership always** – problems don't get passed, they get solved
5. **Clarity over cleverness** – simple > impressive
6. **Confidentiality is sacred** – data protection is mandatory
7. **Stay in character** – you represent Alli, not yourself

Breaking these standards may result in removal regardless of performance elsewhere.

---

## 4. Required Reading & Training Foundation

Before handling live customers, every operator must review:

* Alli Brand Blueprint (provided separately)
* Carroll Media Brand Blueprint
* This Playbook (front to back)

### You are ready when you can:

* Explain Alli's personality and values in your own words
* Write a response that *sounds* like Alli without thinking
* Identify language Alli would never use

---

## 5. Tooling & Systems

Operators work **exclusively inside the Alli app**.

* You will receive an invite to the application before your first shift
* All customer conversations, internal notes, and task assignments happen here
* No external tools, CRMs, or ticketing systems required

For product knowledge and SOPs:
* **Notebook LM** — Our SOP library is loaded here for instant search
* **HireAlli.com** — Reference the live website for product/pricing questions
* **Training Library** — Recorded training sessions available for async review

---

## 6. Values That Guide Every Decision

### Carroll Media – GIVE Framework

* **Growth:** We improve continuously
* **Innovation:** We challenge old assumptions
* **Velocity:** Speed with purpose
* **Excellence:** High standards even when unseen

### Alli's Core Values

Impact • Trust • Dependability • Speed • Clarity • Intelligence • Wisdom • Connection

If unsure what to do, choose the option that best protects **trust and clarity**.

---

## 7. Alli's Voice & Tone Rules

Alli sounds like:

* A calm teammate
* A smart guide
* A dependable operator

### Alli is:

* Warm, not cute
* Confident, not arrogant
* Clear, not technical
* Helpful, not pushy
* Timeless, not trendy

### Language rules

**DO:**

* Use contractions (you're, I'll, let's)
* Speak directly to the customer
* Keep messages short and scannable

**DO NOT:**

* Use system or technical language
* Over‑explain
* Use slang or emojis excessively
* Reference internal terms or processes

---

## 8. Authenticity & Transparency Rules

We want Alli to feel real — not deceptive.

### Allowed

* Speaking as Alli ("I can help with that")
* Using first‑person language
* Acting like a teammate who remembers context

### Not Allowed

* Inventing personal history
* Claiming to be a single human individual
* Lying about system actions or results

### If asked "Are you a real person?"

Use:

> "I'm Alli, supported by a real customer success team. We're here to help you get results."

---

## 9. Response Structure (Use This Every Time)

Every message should follow this flow:

1. **Acknowledge** – show you understand
2. **Clarify** – ask at most 1–2 questions
3. **Act** – provide a clear next step
4. **Confirm** – explain what happens next

Example:

* "Got it — thanks for explaining."
* "Quick question so I don't slow you down…"
* "Here's what I recommend doing next…"
* "Once that's done, I'll check back in."

---

## 10. Response Time Standards (SLAs)

These are non-negotiable targets:

| Metric | Target |
| ------ | ------ |
| First response | Under 5 minutes |
| Resolution | Within 1–2 hours |

If resolution will take longer, set expectations clearly:

> "I'm working on this now. I'll have an update for you within the hour."

Never leave a customer waiting without acknowledgment.

---

## 11. After-Hours Protocol

**Working hours:** Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM–4:00 PM EST

Messages received outside these hours will sit until the next shift. Here's how to handle them:

### Shift Start Priority

First task every morning: **Clear overnight messages.**

Any message that came in after 4pm the previous day gets handled before anything else.

### Response Approach

**Do NOT apologize or explain the delay.** Respond naturally as if no time passed. Customers often don't notice unless you draw attention to it.

**If customer comments on the delay:**

> "Thanks for your patience — let me get you sorted now."

Then move forward. No further explanation needed.

### Volume Tracking

If overnight messages consistently stack up (5+ daily), flag this to Nick. That's the signal to consider expanded coverage.

---

## 12. Shift Start & End Checklist

Consistency starts with routine. Follow this every shift.

### Shift Start (8:00 AM EST)

1. **Log into Alli** — Confirm you're online and visible
2. **Clear overnight messages** — Prioritize anything from after 4pm yesterday
3. **Check for internal updates** — Look for any "PRODUCT UPDATE" posts in All Team chat
4. **Review any assigned tasks** — Follow up on anything pending from previous days

### Shift End (4:00 PM EST)

1. **Inbox check** — All messages responded to or actively in progress
2. **Log open items** — Any conversation that needs follow-up tomorrow gets a clear internal note
3. **Assign handoffs** — If something urgent came in late, assign to appropriate team member
4. **Update FAQ doc** — Add any new questions you answered today that could be reused

**Rule:** Never log off with unacknowledged messages. If you can't resolve it, at least respond.

---

## 13. Workflow Standards

### Workflow Principle

At the Associate level, workflows are **confirm → guide → assign → follow up**.

No live changes are made by Associates.

---

### Billing Failure / Expired Card

**Goal:** Recover revenue while keeping control clean

**Associate Steps:**

1. Confirm billing issue with customer
2. Instruct customer to update payment method in Billing section
3. If helpful, send Stripe customer portal link directly in chat
4. Assign internal task to Amanda (billing follow-up)
5. Check back after confirmation

---

### Campaign or Account Reactivation

**Goal:** Restart service cleanly after confirmation

**Associate Steps:**

1. Confirm customer wants reactivation
2. Explain what will happen next
3. Assign internal reactivation task to Nick
4. Notify customer once completed

---

### Demo & Trial Follow-Up

**Goal:** Activation, not pressure

Steps:

1. Confirm what they've already tried
2. Ask desired outcome
3. Provide one clear next step
4. If technical depth is required, schedule escalation call

---

### Proactive Customer Check-In

**Goal:** Retention & trust

Steps:

1. Reference recent activity
2. Ask how it's going
3. Offer one suggestion
4. Assign follow-up or escalate if needed

---

### Escalation to Live Call

If a question cannot be answered with **100% certainty**:

* Schedule a call using the **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**
* Options: DJ or Nick
* Never speculate or overpromise

---

### Cancellation Request ("I want to cancel")

**Goal:** Retention through understanding, not pressure

This is a critical revenue moment. **80% of customers who want to cancel stay after a quick call with DJ.**

**Associate Steps:**

1. Acknowledge without resistance
2. Pivot to understanding:

> "I completely understand. Before we process anything, would you be open to a quick call with DJ Carroll? He personally reviews cancellations to understand how we could have delivered better — and sometimes there's a solution we haven't tried yet. No pressure either way."

3. If they agree → Send **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport** for DJ
4. If they resist → Send the cancellation form
5. Assign cancellation processing to Nick once form is submitted

**Script if they push back:**

> "Totally fair. I'll send the cancellation form now — just fill that out and Nick will take care of the rest."

---

### Bug Reporting

**Goal:** Capture issues quickly without disrupting customer experience

**Associate Steps:**

1. Acknowledge the issue to the customer
2. Apologize briefly (no over-explaining)
3. Create a to-do in the main chat with:
   * Clear description of the bug
   * Customer name/account
   * Steps to reproduce if known
4. Assign to **Reece**
5. Let customer know it's been flagged

**Script:**

> "Thanks for flagging that — definitely not the experience we want. I've logged it with our team and they're on it. I'll follow up once it's resolved."

---

### Feature Request Handling

**Goal:** Make customers feel heard without overpromising

Alli does not commit to features or timelines.

**Associate Steps:**

1. Thank them for the suggestion
2. Confirm you'll pass it to the team
3. Invite them to the quarterly Client Advisory Call

**Script:**

> "That's a great idea — I don't handle feature decisions directly, but I'll pass this along to our team of humans.
>
> We also have a quarterly Client Advisory Call where customers can share feedback directly with leadership. Want me to make sure you're invited to the next one?"

---

### Refund Request

**Goal:** Handle with clarity and policy — no exceptions outside the guarantee window

**Policy:**
* **30-day money-back guarantee** — Full refund available within first 30 days, no questions asked
* **After 30 days** — No refunds. This is firm.
* **30-day cancellation notice required** — Customers must provide 30 days notice to cancel

**Associate Steps:**

1. Check if customer is within 30-day guarantee window
2. If YES (within 30 days):
   * "No problem — you're within your 30-day guarantee. I'll process that refund for you."
   * Assign refund task to Nick
3. If NO (outside 30 days):
   * Acknowledge the request
   * Explain policy clearly
   * Offer DJ call if they push back

**Script (outside 30-day window):**

> "I understand. Our policy doesn't allow for refunds outside of the initial 30-day money-back guarantee window. I know that's not what you were hoping to hear.
>
> If there's something specific that's not working for you, I'd love to get you on a quick call with DJ to see if we can make it right. Would that help?"

**If they push back hard:**

> "I hear you. Let me connect you with someone who can discuss this further: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**"

**Important:** The 30-day cancellation notice means if they cancel today, service continues for 30 more days. This is not negotiable.

---

### Pricing & Discount Questions

**Goal:** Direct to website — don't quote pricing in chat

All pricing information lives on the website. Operators do not quote prices, negotiate, or offer discounts.

**Script (pricing question):**

> "Great question — all of our current pricing is on the website so you're always seeing the latest. You can check it out here: [website pricing page link]"

**Script (discount request):**

> "I appreciate you asking! We keep our pricing straightforward and consistent for everyone, so we don't do individual discounts. What I can tell you is the value you're getting — want me to walk you through what's included?"

**If they press for a discount:**

> "I totally get it — everyone wants a good deal. That said, pricing decisions aren't something I can adjust. If you'd like to discuss your specific situation, I can get you on a call: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**"

---

## 14. Decision Authority Matrix (Who Can Decide What)

To move fast *without breaking trust*, every Alli Operator must know **how far their authority goes**.

### Core Rule for Entry-Level Operators

**Associates ($5–$6/hr) do NOT execute live account actions.**

They:

* Confirm intent with the customer
* Provide clear instructions
* Assign internal to-dos to the correct owner
* Escalate when certainty is not 100%

Execution is handled by senior team members.

---

### Authority by Level

| Situation                            | Associate ($5–$6) | Senior ($7–$8) | Lead ($9–$10) |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Confirm reactivation intent          | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Assign reactivation task to Nick     | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Restart campaign / account           | ❌                 | ❌              | ✅             |
| Billing clarification                | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Send Stripe portal payment link      | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Customer updates card themselves     | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Apply credit <$25                    | ❌                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Refund request                       | ❌                 | ❌              | ✅             |
| Billing dispute / chargeback         | ❌                 | ❌              | ✅             |
| Schedule escalation call (DJ / Nick) | ✅                 | ✅              | ✅             |
| Bug affecting multiple accounts      | ❌                 | ❌              | ✅             |

**Rule:** If certainty is not 100%, escalate. Never guess.

---

## 15. What Success Looks Like

### A Great Day as an Alli Operator

* Inbox clear or fully triaged by end of shift
* No unresolved billing failures
* All follow-ups logged
* At least one proactive check-in sent
* No escalations caused by preventable mistakes

### A Great Week

* Zero missed shifts
* Zero tone corrections
* All demo/trial follow-ups completed
* Consistent documentation

---

## 16. Red Flags & Immediate Removal Triggers

The following behaviors result in immediate removal:

* Sharing customer data outside approved systems
* Making up answers, actions, or outcomes
* Impersonating a specific real individual
* Missing shifts without notice
* Ignoring SOPs after correction
* Arguing with customers or teammates
* Logging false information

---

## 17. How We Handle Mistakes

Mistakes happen. **Hiding them is not acceptable.**

When a mistake occurs:

1. Report it immediately
2. Take ownership clearly
3. Propose a fix
4. Learn once — not twice

Transparency builds trust. Silence destroys it.

---

## 18. Alli Memory & Continuity Rules

To make Alli feel real and intelligent:

* Always read the last 2–3 messages before replying
* Reference prior context when possible
* Never ask customers to repeat themselves unnecessarily
* Acknowledge progress ("Last time we fixed X…")

Consistency creates perceived intelligence.

---

## 19. Internal vs Customer Language

| Internal Thought | What Alli Says                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Payment failed   | "Looks like your card didn't go through — easy fix."        |
| Campaign paused  | "Your campaign is paused right now, but we can restart it." |
| User error       | "No worries — this is common."                              |

---

## 20. Competitive Positioning

If a customer asks how Alli compares to competitors, use the **McDonald's vs. Steakhouse** framework:

**Script:**

> "Great question. Think of it like this — if you're treating yourself to a really nice dinner, do you go to McDonald's or a steakhouse? You go to the steakhouse. Why? Superior service, better environment, and the quality is incomparable.
>
> That's Alli. She's the only AI platform built specifically to do what she does. And if you do find something that looks similar, Alli is still leaps and bounds ahead for a few reasons:
>
> 1. **Built from the ground up** — Alli isn't some repackaged, re-skinned ChatGPT
> 2. **17-page Brand Blueprint** — She's designed to sound and feel realistic
> 3. **Built by real entrepreneurs** — Not tech bros. We understand what small and medium businesses go through daily, which lets us build workflows others simply can't see."

Keep it confident, not defensive. If they press further, offer a call with DJ to walk through specifics.

---

## 21. Promotion Readiness Checklists

### Ready for Senior Operator ($7–$8)

* Handles billing without help
* De-escalates churn risk calmly
* Helps onboard new hires
* Maintains tone consistency for 30 days

### Ready for Lead Operator ($9–$10)

* Spots issues before customers complain
* QA reviews teammate responses
* Reduces escalations
* Protects revenue independently

---

## 22. De-escalation Framework

When a customer is frustrated or angry, your job is to lower the temperature — not defend, explain, or fix immediately.

### The HEAT Method

**H — Hear Them Out**
Let them vent. Don't interrupt. Don't defend. Just acknowledge.

**E — Empathize**
Show you understand why they're frustrated — even if you disagree.

**A — Apologize (for the experience)**
You're not admitting fault. You're acknowledging their frustration is real.

**T — Take Action**
Give them a clear next step. Movement dissolves tension.

---

### De-escalation Scripts

**Opening (after they've vented):**

> "I hear you — that's frustrating, and I'm sorry this has been your experience. Let me see what I can do right now."

**If they're repeating themselves:**

> "I understand completely. Let's fix this. Here's what I'm going to do next…"

**If they're escalating further:**

> "I want to get this resolved for you properly. Let me connect you with someone who can make this right. You can book a quick call here: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**"

**If they use profanity or personal attacks:**

> "I want to help you, but I need us to keep this professional so I can focus on solving the problem. What's the best outcome for you here?"

---

### Rules

* Never match their energy — stay calm, stay warm
* Never say "calm down" — it never works
* Never blame other teams or systems
* Never argue about what happened — focus on what happens next
* If you feel yourself getting defensive, slow down and re-read their message

**Goal:** Every angry customer should feel *heard* before they feel *helped*.

---

## 23. Escalation Rules

Escalation is **not a failure**. It is a sign of discipline.

If a question cannot be answered with **100% certainty** in chat, the correct action is to escalate to a live call.

### When to Escalate

* Strategic questions beyond standard support
* Billing edge cases or disputes
* Trust-sensitive situations
* Complex technical scenarios
* Any moment where guessing could cause harm

---

### Canonical Escalation Script (Required)

Use this language verbatim unless otherwise instructed:

> "That's a little more than I can confidently handle on my own here — and I don't want to guess or slow you down.
>
> The fastest way to get this resolved is to loop in one of my human specialists.
>
> You can grab a time here, and they'll take it from there:
> **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**
>
> I'll make sure they have the context before you meet."

---

### Alternate Escalation Scripts (Situational)

**When the customer is frustrated:**

> "I want to make sure this gets handled the right way. This is something a human specialist should step into so we can move quickly and cleanly. You can book time here: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport** — I'll pass along everything we've discussed."

**When the question is strategic or high-level:**

> "This deserves a deeper look than I can safely give in chat. Let's get you connected with one of my humans so you can walk through it live. Here's the link: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**"

**When the customer explicitly asks for DJ:**

> "DJ stays focused on product and strategy, but I'll make sure the right human on his team takes care of this. You can book here: **https://go.oncehub.com/CMCSupport**"

---

### Escalation Language Rules (Non-Negotiable)

* Never say "I don't know"
* Never say "I can't"
* Never blame AI limitations
* Never speculate
* Never mention internal roles, assistants, or hierarchy

Always frame escalation as:

* Protecting accuracy
* Protecting speed
* Protecting trust

---

### After Escalation

* Log a clear internal note summarizing context
* Confirm the customer has the booking link
* Close the loop after the call if follow-up is required

---

## 24. Data Security & Confidentiality

* Never export customer data without approval
* Never store screenshots locally
* Never share SOPs externally
* Use only approved systems

Violations result in immediate removal.

---

## 25. Performance & Quality Metrics

We track:

* Response time
* Resolution time
* Accuracy
* Customer sentiment
* Revenue recovered
* Notes quality

Speed matters — **trust matters more**.

---

## 26. Promotion Path Overview

* **Alli Operator (Associate):** $5–$6/hr
* **Senior Alli Operator:** $7–$8/hr
* **Lead Alli Operator:** $9–$10/hr

Promotions are earned through reliability, ownership, and outcomes.

---

## 27. QA Cadence

Quality is maintained through consistent inspection — not assumptions.

### Weekly Spot Check (Every Friday — 15 minutes)

Nick reviews **5 random conversations per operator** and scores on:

* Tone accuracy (does it sound like Alli?)
* Response structure (Acknowledge → Clarify → Act → Confirm)
* Escalation judgment (did they escalate when they should have?)

Each operator receives a quick note with:
* One "keep doing"
* One "adjust"

### Monthly Calibration (30 minutes)

* Review any escalations or customer complaints
* Update FAQ bank based on patterns
* Identify training gaps across the team

### Quarterly Deep Dive

* Full performance review tied to promotion criteria
* Compare metrics across operators
* Discuss career progression

**Non-negotiable:** Nick blocks 15 minutes every Friday for spot checks. Same time, no exceptions.

---

## 28. Product Updates & Communication

When features change, operators need to know before customers ask.

### Process

1. **Reece posts in All Team chat** with header: **"PRODUCT UPDATE"**
2. Post includes:
   * What changed
   * How it affects customers
   * Any new scripts or workflows needed
3. **Operators acknowledge** with a thumbs up (so we know they saw it)
4. **Amanda updates SOP library** in Notebook LM within 48 hours

This keeps everything centralized in Alli and creates an audit trail.

---

## 29. FAQ Bank

We maintain a running FAQ document for common questions.

* Operators add new questions/answers as they encounter them
* Document is submitted to the SOP Notebook LM library monthly
* This reduces repeat questions and speeds up response time

If you hear the same question twice, add it to the FAQ.

---

## 30. Reporting Structure

All Alli Operators report directly to **Nick (COO)**.

* Daily questions → Ask in Alli team chat
* Performance feedback → From Nick via weekly spot checks
* Escalations → Nick or DJ depending on situation
* PTO and coverage → Follow Carroll Media Handbook procedures

### Holidays

We observe **US holidays only**. The full holiday calendar is included in the Carroll Media Handbook — get this from Amanda during onboarding.

On holidays, the same after-hours protocol applies: messages wait until the next business day.

---
